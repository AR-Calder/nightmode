# nightmode
A simple bash script to switch between two wallpapers for a "nightmode" effect.

Assumes "DAY" and "NIGHT" are in the same directory as the script

Made for GTK3, unknown if other versions supported. 



To get working:
Add "export_x_info.sh" to crontab @reboot
Add your chosen images to the nightmode directory as "DAY" and "NIGHT"
Restart - it should now work.
